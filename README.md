## 💡 Technical Skills Built During PG-DAC Projects

### 🛠️ Full-Stack Development (MERN)

- Created a full-stack food delivery app (**Food Fusion**) using **MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js**
- Integrated **Stripe Payment Gateway** for checkout and orders
- Implemented **React Router** and conditional rendering for user/admin flows
- Managed independent frontend and backend folders with clean architecture

---

### 🎨 Frontend Engineering (React)

- Built responsive, component-based UI for the **Kanban Board** using **ReactJS** and **Tailwind CSS**
- A task management tool that visualizes workflow using draggable columns and cards.
- Users can freely move both entire columns and individual tasks to reflect progress and priority.

# 🎓 Academic Projects – PG-DAC (CDAC Nagpur, India – 2023) [![PG-DAC](https://img.shields.io/badge/PG--DAC_(2023)-CDAC_Nagpur,_India-blue)](https://www.cdac.in/)

Welcome to my collection of academic projects developed during the **Post Graduate Diploma in Advanced Computing (PG-DAC)** program at **SoftPolynomials, Nagpur** — an authorized training center under **CDAC (Centre for Development of Advanced Computing)** in 2023.  
> 🕒 _Originally developed during PG-DAC in 2023 — later organized and published for transparency, learning, and portfolio presentation._

These projects reflect practical, hands-on training in full-stack development using modern frameworks like ReactJS, Spring Boot, and the MERN stack.

## 💡 Technical Skills Built During PG-DAC Projects

### 🛠️ Full-Stack Development (MERN)

- Created a full-stack food delivery app (**Food Fusion**) using **MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js**
- Integrated **Stripe Payment Gateway** for checkout and orders
- Implemented **React Router** and conditional rendering for user/admin flows
- Managed independent frontend and backend folders with clean architecture

---

### 🎨 Frontend Engineering (React)

- Built responsive, component-based UI for the **Kanban Board** using **ReactJS** and **Tailwind CSS**
- A task management tool that visualizes workflow using draggable columns and cards.
- Users can freely move both entire columns and individual tasks to reflect progress and priority.

## 📚 Current Tech Focus  

Building modular, production-grade apps using Spring Boot + ReactJS.   

📌 **Explore my pinned GitHub repositories to see how the skills gained during CDAC evolved into independent full-stack platforms.**

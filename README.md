## 📚 Academic Context

These projects were developed during my **PG-DAC (Post Graduate Diploma in Advanced Computing)** at **CDAC, Nagpur** in **2023**, focused on enterprise-level full-stack development.
, focused on enterprise-level full-stack development.

They helped me strengthen key development skills across:

---

### 🎨 Frontend Development

- Built responsive, component-driven UIs using **ReactJS**
- Applied **Tailwind CSS** for modern and clean design layouts
- Used **Context API** for global state management in larger apps
- Implemented **HTML5 drag-and-drop** features in interactive boards
- Developed routing, search filters, and local storage-based cart systems

---

### 🧩 Backend & API Development

- Built secure, RESTful APIs using **Spring Boot (Java)**
- Applied **JWT authentication** for role-based access control
- Designed modular service-controller-repository architectures
- Handled full-stack request/response cycles for multiple user roles

---

### 🛢️ Database & Data Flow

- Worked with **MySQL** for relational database schema and queries
- Performed **CRUD operations** and managed entity relationships using **JPA/Hibernate**
- Gained introductory exposure to **MongoDB** in a MERN-based project
  - (Note: While I built the frontend and project structure, backend APIs were largely scaffolded or team-guided.)

---

### 💡 Development Practices

- Practiced clean code structure with separation of concerns
- Integrated **end-to-end features** like login, registration, dashboards, and admin panels
- Built role-specific user flows in multi-page applications
- Collaborated in team settings to simulate real-world project delivery

---

📌 I’m currently focused on mastering **Java + Spring Boot**, **ReactJS**, and **MySQL** — and actively building **monolithic applications** with scalable architecture.

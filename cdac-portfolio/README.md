This portfolio showcases the projects I built during my Post Graduate Diploma in Advanced Computing (PG-DAC) at CDAC in 2023 â€” focused on full-stack Java development, clean architecture, and scalable solutions.

Feel free to explore these projects â€” each one represents hands-on learning and my transition toward production-grade development.

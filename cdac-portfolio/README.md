A focused collection of full-stack projects built during and after my Post Graduate Diploma in Advanced Computing (PG-DAC) at **CDAC – SoftPolynomials, Nagpur** in 2023.

This compilation reflects my transition from academic learning to building industry-aligned, full-stack applications using modern tools and clean architectural practices.

> ✨ From core programming to full-stack development — CDAC helped bridge theory with hands-on, industry-relevant project experience.
> 🕒 Originally built in 2023 and later organized, refined, and published for clarity, learning, and portfolio presentation.
